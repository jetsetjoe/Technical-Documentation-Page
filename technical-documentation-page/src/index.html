      <p>
        The Citabria 7KCAB is a fully aerobatic variant of the 7ECA Citabria tailwheel airplane. Notably, the 7KCAB is equipped with inverted fuel and oil systems designed for inverted flight.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is intended as a general overview of the 7KCAB Citabria's technical specifications and is not intended to replace official documentation. Official FAA placards and limitations are the authority if any inconsistency exists in this document.

      <p>
        This section is intended as an overview covering three common emergency maneuvres. This is by no means comprehensive and good judgement should always be exercised by the pilot to determine the proper course of action in an emergency situation.
      </p>
      <h5>Spins </h5>
      <p>If a spin is anadvertently entered, recovery procedure is as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>Throttle- Closed </li>
          <li>Rudder- Full deflection opposite direction of rotation </li>
          <li>Elevator- Slightly forward of neutral </li>
          <li>Ailerons- Neutral </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h5>Stalls </h5>
      <p> To recover from a stall:
        <ol>
          <li>Nose attitude- Lower </li>
          <li>Throttle- Full Open </li>
          <li>Use rudder to maintain lateral control </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h5>Emergency exit/Bail out </h5>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Throttle- Closed </li>
          <li>Door- Jettison </li>
          <li>Using the cabin door frame for support, dive straight out and slightly aft of wing struts </li>
          <li>Parachute- open immediately when clear of aircraft </li>

        </ol>
      </p>

    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Normal_Procedures">
    <header>Normal Procedures </header>
    <article>
      <p>
        These procedures are part of normal operation of the aircraft.

        <h5>Takeoff-normal</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Throttle- Full Open </li>
          <li>Engine instruments- Check normal indications </li>
          <li>Attitude- Raise tail to level flight attitude </li>
          <li>Lift-off- 55-60MPH </li>
          <li>Climb- 75-80MPH </li>

        </ol>

        During crosswind conditions, place the control stick into the wind and assume a tail high attitude with the elevator to prevent drifting or premature lift-off.
      </p>

      <h5>Cruise </h5>
      <p>The fuel mixture should be leaned when below 75% of maximum power. Lean to peak EGT, if no EGT is installed then lean until engine roughness is noted then enrich until smooth.
        <ol>
          <li>Level-off- Trim </li>
          <li>Airspeed- Accelerate to desired cruise speed </li>
          <li>Throttle- Set RPM to cruise power </li>
          <li>Fuel boost pump- Off </li>
          <li>Mixture- Lean when below 75% power </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h5>Landing- Normal </h5>
      <p>
        Either wheel landings or full stall three points are permissible. During gusty winds, increase airspeed 5mph above normal followed by a wheel landing. Full stall three point landings are recommended for soft or rough fields.

        <ol>
          <li>Seat and shoulder harness- Fastened </li>
          <li>Mixture- Rich </li>
          <li>Fuel boost pump- On </li>
          <li>Brakes- Check firm </li>
          <li>Approach airspeed- 60-70MPH </li>
          <li>Throttle- As desired to control rate of descent </li>
        </ol>

        The use of wheel brakes is not recommended until after the tail wheel is in contact with the ground.
